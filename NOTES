POSTGRESQL: Is an object-RDBMS(Relational Database Management System). It has open source, which is released under the permissive PostgresSQL License.

INSTALLING POSTGRES:
  brew install postgresql

BEING ABLE TO RECALL POSTGRES FROM WITHIN HOMEBREW: I don't fully understand this, but from what I understand, in order for you to run postgreSQL,
  After it's been installed, apparently it's a Homebrew Background Service (We'll look deeper into this).

  LAUNCHCTL: Loads and unloads services that start at login (I think postgresql is one such service.)
    In OS X, these services are represented by files ending with .plist (Stands for Property List) These
    plists are usually stored in either ~/Library/LaunchAgents or /Library/LaunchAgents. You load them
    (i.e. tell them to start at login) with launchctl load $PATH_TO_LIST and unload them with launchctl
    unload $PATH_TO_LIST. Loading a plist tells the program it represents (e.g. redis) to start at login,
    while unloading it tells the program not to start at login.

    NOTE: To launch it this way, you need to know where Homebrew plists are. Homebrew includes an interface for managing this without using ln, launchctl or knowing where plists are.

    CODE FOR USING THE INTERFACE:
      ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
      launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist

    INSTALL BREW SERVICES: homebrew/services one time.

    STARTING POSTGRESQL:
      EXAMPLE:
        brew services start mysql


PSQL COMMAND LIST:
-GOING INTO POSTGRES MODE: psql postgres
-COMMANDING THE HOST WE WANT TO CONNECT TO: -h
-COMMANDING THE USER WE WANT TO CONNECT WITH: -U
-COMMANDING THE POST WE WANT TO CONNECT TO(default is 5432): -p
  QUERYING: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: psql -h localhost -U desiredUserName -p 4000 databasename

    OPTION 2- USING THE FULL STRING AND LETTING PSQL PARSE IT:
      EXAMPLE: psql "dbname=dbhere host=hosthere user=userhere password=pwhere port=5432 ssl"

-CHANGE TO POSTGRES USER AND OPEN PSQL PROMPT: sudo -u postgres psql postgres

ROLES
-CREATE ROLE: CREATE ROLE desiredrolename WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'passwordname' CREATEDB;
-CREATE ROLE WITH MULTIPLE PRIVILEGES: CREATE ROLE desiredrolename WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD
   'passwordname' CREATEDB CREATEROLE REPLICATION SUPERUSER;
-ALTER ROLE: ALTER ROLE desiredrolename CREATEROLE CREATEDB REPLICATION SUPERUSER;
-DROP ROLE: DROP ROLE desiredrole;

DATABASES
-CREATE DATABASE: CREATE DATABASE dbname WITH OWNER chosenrole ENCODING 'UTF8';
-GRANT PRIVILEGES TO NEW USER: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE dbname TO selectrole
-DROP DATABASE: DROP DATABASE databasename;
-CONNECT TO DATABASE: \c dbname

TABLES
-CREATING A TABLE: CREATE TABLE tableName(id serial PRIMARY KEY, desiredColName1 datatype, desiredColName2 datatype)
  FURTHER EXPLANATION: You first name the table, and in the parenthesis, you have fields separated by commas.
    You should always put id serial PRIMARY KEY: The purpose of this is to have it automatically give each row an id by increments of 1.
    After this you put your column name and the datatype you wish to give it (see list of datatypes)
-LIST TABLES IN DATABASE: \d
-LIST TABLES IN CONNECTED DATABASE: \dt
-DESCRIBE A TABLE: \d employees       //table name. This whole content doesn't go in the command.
-LIST ALL TABLES IN DATABASE ALONG WITH SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: \d+
-DESCRIBE A TABLE WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: \d+ users

LISTING
-LIST ALL DATABASES: \l
-LIST ALL DATABASES WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: \l+
-LIST ROLES: postgres=# \du
-LIST OF ALL AVAILABLE COMMANDS: \?
-TURNING QUERY TIMING ON(In milliseconds): \timing
-LIST ALL SCHEMAS: \dn
-LIST ALL SCHEMAS WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: \dn+
-LIST ALL FUNCTIONS: \df


MISC
-QUIT FROM POSTGRES SHELL: \q
-TEXT EDITOR INSIDE PSQL (This is pretty handy for query modifications): \e
