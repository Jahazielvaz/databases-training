POSTGRESQL: Is an object-RDBMS(Relational Database Management System). It has open source, which is released under the permissive PostgresSQL License.

INSTALLING POSTGRES:
  brew install postgresql

BEING ABLE TO RECALL POSTGRES FROM WITHIN HOMEBREW: I don't fully understand this, but from what I understand, in order for you to run postgreSQL,
  After it's been installed, apparently it's a Homebrew Background Service (We'll look deeper into this).

  LAUNCHCTL: Loads and unloads services that start at login (I think postgresql is one such service.)
    In OS X, these services are represented by files ending with .plist (Stands for Property List) These
    plists are usually stored in either ~/Library/LaunchAgents or /Library/LaunchAgents. You load them
    (i.e. tell them to start at login) with launchctl load $PATH_TO_LIST and unload them with launchctl
    unload $PATH_TO_LIST. Loading a plist tells the program it represents (e.g. redis) to start at login,
    while unloading it tells the program not to start at login.

    NOTE: To launch it this way, you need to know where Homebrew plists are. Homebrew includes an interface for managing this without using ln, launchctl or knowing where plists are.

    CODE FOR USING THE INTERFACE:
      ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
      launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist

    INSTALL BREW SERVICES: homebrew/services one time.

    STARTING POSTGRESQL:
      EXAMPLE:
        brew services start mysql


PSQL COMMAND LIST:
-GOING INTO POSTGRES MODE: psql postgres
-COMMANDING THE HOST WE WANT TO CONNECT TO: -h
-COMMANDING THE USER WE WANT TO CONNECT WITH: -U
-COMMANDING THE POST WE WANT TO CONNECT TO(default is 5432): -p
  QUERYING: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: psql -h localhost -U desiredUserName -p 4000 databasename

    OPTION 2- USING THE FULL STRING AND LETTING PSQL PARSE IT:
      EXAMPLE: psql "dbname=dbhere host=hosthere user=userhere password=pwhere port=5432 ssl"
